# 📊 Current Git Status

## Your Situation:

### ✅ What You Have:
- **Branch:** `2025-10-30-helk-7TRkQ` (not main)
- **Modified file:** `mmie.py` (staged changes)
- **Good additions:**
  - `_unwrap_peft()` function for PEFT model handling
  - `set_per_sequence_alphas()` for dynamic gating
  - Improved SAE device handling
  - Better `_resolve_blocks()` logic

### ❌ What You DON'T Have:
- **Adversarial ES evaluation** (removed)
- **Deterministic stability tie-breaking** (removed)

---

## 🔍 Why Nothing Commits:

You were in the **WRONG directory**:
- ❌ You were in: `C:\Users\Srinivas's G14\Downloads\SAE_2\SAE_Hons\`
- ✅ You should be in: `C:\Users\Srinivas's G14\.cursor\worktrees\SAE_Hons\7TRkQ\`

---

## 🎯 What You Should Do:

### **Option A: Push As-Is (No Adversarial Testing)**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Your improvements (PEFT unwrap, per-seq alphas) are good
- ✅ Quick - just commit and push

**Cons:**
- ❌ No adversarial robustness testing (reviewers will ask)
- ⚠️ Non-deterministic stability selection (minor issue)

**Commands:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Srinivas's G14\.cursor\worktrees\SAE_Hons\7TRkQ"
git add mmie.py
git commit -m "feat: Add PEFT unwrap + per-sequence dynamic gating"
git push origin 2025-10-30-helk-7TRkQ
```

---

### **Option B: Add Adversarial ES + Push (RECOMMENDED)**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Publication-grade with adversarial testing
- ✅ All your improvements PLUS research rigor

**Cons:**
- Takes 2 more minutes

**I can do this for you!** Just say "yes, add adversarial ES back"

## 🤷 Which Do You Want?

**Tell me:**
1. **"Push as-is"** → I'll help you commit without adversarial ES
2. **"Add adversarial ES"** → I'll add it back and then help you commit
3. **"I'm confused"** → I'll explain more clearly
