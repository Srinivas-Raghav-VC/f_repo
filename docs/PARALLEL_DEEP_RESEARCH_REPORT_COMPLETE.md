## Executive Summary

### SAE Design Choice is a Critical Performance Lever
The Multilingual Machine Unlearning Experiment's (MMIE) choice of a Top-K Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) with k=32 and an expansion factor of 16 is a sound starting point for identifying Hindi-specific features. However, 2025 benchmarks show this architecture trails state-of-the-art alternatives. Matryoshka SAEs, which learn hierarchical features, demonstrate superior feature disentanglement on the comprehensive SAEBench benchmark [1] [2]. While Top-K variants perform well on concept detection, they can suffer from pathologies like feature splitting and absorption [3]. **Recommendation: Upgrade the SAE architecture to a Matryoshka-Top-K variant or incorporate feature decorrelation losses to improve feature purity and reduce representational redundancy before final experimental runs** [4].

### Dynamic SAE Guardrails Outperform Gradient-Only Unlearning
While gradient-based methods are a common approach to unlearning, recent research from April 2025 demonstrates that a dynamic application of SAEs offers a superior forget-utility trade-off. The "Dynamic SAE Guardrails" (DSG) method substantially outperforms leading unlearning methods by offering enhanced computational efficiency, stability, and resistance to relearning attacks [5]. This activation-based approach is also more interpretable than purely gradient-based techniques [5]. **Recommendation: Adopt DSG as the primary unlearning intervention. Retain gradient-based feature identification, such as from GradSAE, as a causal validation step to ensure the most influential features are being targeted.**

### ReFT Requires a Gating Mechanism for Effective Suppression
The experiment's comparison of LoRA and Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for suppression is pertinent, but using vanilla ReFT for unlearning is theoretically flawed. ReFT was designed for enhancement, and using it alone for suppression is ineffective [6]. The 2025 Gated Representation UNlearning (GRUN) framework solves this by augmenting ReFT with a soft gate function that learns to distinguish and suppress target data [6] [7]. This approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness and utility, updating fewer than 0.05% of parameters [6]. **Recommendation: Implement a GRUN-style gated architecture around the ReFT module. Without this, LoRA applied to q/v projections, despite its potential for collateral damage, is a more straightforward suppression tool.**

### Latent Romanization Creates a Hidden Knowledge Pathway
The MMIE's script-blind evaluation is well-aligned with cutting-edge 2025 research, particularly the "RomanLens" paper, which confirms the existence of "Latent Romanization" [8]. In multilingual models, intermediate layers (e.g., 20-29) frequently represent non-Roman script words in a romanized form before generating the native script output [9] [10]. Activation patching experiments show that semantic concepts are encoded similarly across scripts, suggesting a shared representation [11] [8]. This implies that unlearning only Devanagari-based representations leaves a backdoor open, as the model can still access the knowledge through this latent, English-aligned pathway. **Recommendation: Augment the evaluation suite with probes specifically for romanized Hindi and add negative controls using related but distinct scripts (e.g., Urdu, Marathi) to prevent "phantom knowledge" and measure cross-script leakage.**

### Evaluation Framework Lacks State-of-the-Art Auditing Techniques
The MMIE's 8+ metric evaluation suite is comprehensive but falls short of the most rigorous 2024-2025 auditing standards. Key missing components include activation-space audits and transformation-robustness tests. The "Does Machine Unlearning Truly Remove Knowledge?" (May 2025) paper introduces ActPert, an activation perturbation method to detect residual knowledge traces that input/output methods miss [12] [13]. Furthermore, "Textual Unlearning Gives a False Sense of Unlearning" (June 2024) shows that many unlearning methods fail against paraphrased queries and can even increase privacy risks, with their U-LiRA+ audit detecting a 41.6% True Positive Rate (TPR) on supposedly unlearned data [14]. **Recommendation: Integrate an ActPert-style layer-by-layer activation audit and expand the adversarial test set to include paraphrases, back-translations, and other semantic transformations to ensure robust unlearning.**

### Correlational Layer Selection Must Be Validated with Causal Methods
The proposed layer selection pipeline combining CKA, Procrustes, and ANC is a sophisticated correlational approach. However, mechanistic interpretability literature increasingly emphasizes that representational similarity does not guarantee functional similarity [15]. These methods are prone to identifying correlations that are not causal drivers of the target behavior. Causal techniques like activation patching are required to validate that the selected layers have maximal causal influence on Hindi-related outputs [16] [17]. **Recommendation: Augment the current pipeline with a "patch-then-vote" causal filter. After identifying candidate layers with CKA/Procrustes, perform targeted activation patching to confirm their causal impact before finalizing the selection. Preregister selection thresholds to prevent p-hacking.**

### GradSAE Identifies Fewer, More Potent Causal Features
The experiment's three feature selection strategies (activation, semantic, gradient-based) cover the main approaches. The May 2025 GradSAE paper provides a critical insight: not all activated SAE features are causally influential [18]. By incorporating output-gradient information, GradSAE identifies a smaller but more potent set of latents that are effective for model steering [18]. This moves beyond simple correlation (activation-based) to causal attribution. **Recommendation: Use an ensemble of GradSAE and semantic filters for high-precision feature deletion. The broader, activation-based selection can be retained for a higher-recall, "blunter" unlearning approach for comparison.**

### Statistical Guardrails Are Incomplete, Inflating Error Rates
The use of bootstrap CIs (n=2000) and 5-seed stability selection demonstrates a commitment to rigor. However, performing tests across six decision gates without correction for multiple comparisons significantly inflates the Type I error rate. Standard statistical practice for ML experiments recommends against the overly conservative Bonferroni correction, favoring methods like the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) [19] [20]. **Recommendation: Apply a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction (e.g., at q=0.1) to all multi-gate comparisons. Report seed-disaggregated results and confidence intervals for all key metrics to provide a complete picture of variance** [21] [22].

### Critical State-of-the-Art Baselines Are Missing
To claim state-of-the-art performance, the MMIE must compare against a broader set of baselines. Missing methods include simple but important ones like zero-shot prompting (instructing the model to forget), random feature/layer ablation, and naive fine-tuning on unrelated data to induce catastrophic forgetting. More importantly, it lacks a comparison to the novel subspace-based UNLEARN method (NAACL 2025), which reports superior performance to previous techniques [23]. **Recommendation: Implement zero-shot prompting, random ablation, and the UNLEARN method as baselines before submission to properly contextualize the experiment's contributions.**

### NeurIPS Readiness is High but Blocked by Four Fixable Gaps
The MMIE methodology is novel, timely, and addresses a critical multilingual challenge, making it a strong candidate for a top-tier conference. However, its current state has four critical gaps that would likely lead to rejection: (1) lack of an activation-space audit (ActPert), (2) no correction for multiple statistical comparisons, (3) an incomplete set of SOTA baselines (esp. UNLEARN), and (4) no discussion of the ethical implications of cross-script knowledge spillover revealed by latent romanization. **Recommendation: Address these four red flags by implementing the recommended fixes. This will elevate the paper from a promising experiment to a rigorous, publication-ready contribution.**

## 1. Problem Context & Objectives—Why Multilingual Unlearning Now?

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied by increasing regulatory and ethical pressure to manage the knowledge they contain. Mandates like the GDPR's "right to be forgotten" require mechanisms for selectively removing specific information from trained models without costly full retraining [13]. While machine unlearning has emerged as a promising field, most research has focused on high-resource languages like English. This project's focus on Hindi unlearning addresses a critical gap, providing a high-leverage testbed for the unique challenges of non-Roman and medium-resource languages, where issues like data scarcity, cultural nuance, and complex script representations are paramount [24] [25] [26].

---

## 2. SAE Foundations: Selecting the Right Sparse Autoencoder

**Key Takeaway:** The choice of a Top-K SAE is reasonable, but 2025 research indicates that Matryoshka or Adaptive-K variants offer superior feature disentanglement and reconstruction quality, which are critical for precise unlearning. Moving from correlational feature identification to causal influence via methods like GradSAE is essential for robust results.

### 2.1 SAEBench Findings: Top-K vs. Matryoshka and Other Variants
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a powerful tool for decomposing LLM activations into sparse, monosemantic features, making them ideal for interpretability and targeted interventions like unlearning [4] [27]. The MMIE codebase uses a Top-K SAE, which enforces a hard sparsity constraint by retaining only the *k* highest activations [28].

However, the comprehensive SAEBench benchmark (ICML 2025) reveals that while Top-K architectures perform well, they are often outperformed by other variants [1].
- **Matryoshka SAEs (MSAEs)**, which learn hierarchical representations at multiple granularities, show superior feature disentanglement and lower feature absorption rates compared to standard Top-K approaches [29] [2] [3].
- **ReLU SAEs**, a simpler architecture, show comparable performance in unlearning tasks but are outperformed on most other metrics [1].
- **Pathologies:** Standard SAEs can suffer from "feature splitting" (a single concept fragments into multiple features) and "feature absorption" (general features develop blind spots), which MSAEs are designed to mitigate [3].

The MMIE's choice of an expansion factor of 16 is consistent with recent interpretability research [4]. However, the static nature of Top-K may be suboptimal.

### 2.2 GradSAE Mechanics & Causal Latent Validation
A fundamental limitation of standard SAE analysis is that it relies on input-side activations, which is a correlational measure. The May 2025 paper introducing **Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE)** argues that not all activated latents contribute equally to the model's output [18].

GradSAE incorporates output-side gradient information to identify the most *influential* latents, moving from correlation to causality [30] [18]. This allows for more precise model steering and unlearning by focusing interventions only on features with high causal influence on the final output. This aligns with the broader push in mechanistic interpretability towards causal interventions like activation patching over purely observational methods [31] [16].

## 3. Intervention Mechanisms—LoRA vs. ReFT/GRUN Trade-offs

**Key Takeaway:** For suppression tasks like unlearning, vanilla ReFT is ineffective. The GRUN framework, which augments ReFT with a soft gate, provides a highly efficient and precise unlearning mechanism that preserves model utility. LoRA is a simpler but blunter instrument, associated with more collateral forgetting.

Representation Engineering (RepE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for controlling model behavior, but its theoretical grounding is still developing [32] [33]. The MMIE experiment compares two popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for unlearning:

1. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Adapts pretrained models by adding low-rank matrices to specific weights, such as the query (q) and value (v) projections in attention layers [34]. Research shows LoRA's forgetting mechanism is linked to the creation of new, high-ranking singular vectors ("intruder dimensions") [35].
2. **ReFT (Representation Fine-Tuning):** Operates on intermediate representations, learning a low-rank linear transformation to steer activations within a specific subspace [6] [36].

While Wehner (2025) unifies LoRA and ReFT under a common theoretical framework, their suitability for suppression differs dramatically [32]. ReFT was designed for enhancement, and experiments show a ReFT-only intervention actually *reduces* unlearning effectiveness [6].

The **Gated Representation UNlearning (GRUN)** framework (2025) solves this by combining a ReFT module with a soft gate function. The gate learns to identify target data, and the ReFT module then suppresses the corresponding representations [6] [7]. This approach is highly effective and efficient.

| Intervention Method | Mechanism | Parameters Updated | Unlearning Efficacy | Utility Preservation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LoRA (rank-8, q/v)** | Adapts attention q/v weights via low-rank matrices. [35] | >0.1% (approx.) | Moderate | Moderate (induces forgetting via "intruder dimensions" [35]) |
| **ReFT-only (rank-4/8)** | Modifies intermediate representations via linear projection. [6] | <0.05% | Low (reduces efficacy) | High |
| **GRUN (ReFT + Gate)** | Gated ReFT module selectively suppresses target representations. [6] | <0.05% | High | High |

The table highlights that GRUN offers the best of both worlds: high unlearning efficacy with minimal parameter updates and high utility preservation, making it the state-of-the-art choice for ReFT-based suppression [6].

## 4. Multilingual Representation & Latent Romanization Risks

**Key Takeaway:** The discovery of "Latent Romanization" confirms that LLMs use a hidden, Roman-character-based representation for non-Roman scripts. This validates the MMIE's script-blind evaluation but also exposes a critical risk: unlearning only the native script (Devanagari) is insufficient and may create a false sense of security.

### 4.1 RomanLens Evidence
The MMIE's use of script-blind evaluation (romanized Hindi detection, Devanagari gibberish controls) is strongly supported by the 2025 "RomanLens" paper [8]. This research uses mechanistic interpretability techniques to demonstrate that multilingual LLMs internally use romanized representations as a "bridge" for processing non-Roman scripts [11] [8].

Key findings from RomanLens include:
- **Prevalence:** In middle-to-top layers (e.g., 20-29 in LLaMA-2 7B), romanized Hindi subwords appear intermittently before the model generates the final Devanagari script output [9].
- **Shared Semantics:** Activation patching experiments show that LLMs encode concepts similarly whether the input is in native Devanagari or romanized script, indicating a shared underlying representation [11] [8].
- **Layer Dynamics:** When translating into a native script, the target language representations emerge in later layers (e.g., layer 40+). However, romanized representations appear 1-2 layers earlier, suggesting they are a precursor [10].

### 4.2 Designing Gibberish & Cross-Script Controls
The RomanLens findings have profound implications for the MMIE. While they validate the use of romanized probes, they also reveal a major confound. If the unlearning intervention only targets features associated with Devanagari script, the model may still retain and access the forbidden knowledge through the latent romanized pathway.

To mitigate this risk, the evaluation framework must be enhanced:
- **Augmented Probes:** Include a dedicated set of probes using romanized Hindi to measure residual knowledge in this latent space.
- **Negative Controls:** Test for collateral unlearning or leakage by probing related Indic scripts (e.g., Marathi, which also uses Devanagari) and scripts with shared vocabulary but different writing systems (e.g., Urdu).
- **Adversarial Transliteration:** Develop adversarial inputs that use non-standard or ambiguous transliterations to test the robustness of the unlearning.

## 5. Evaluation Framework Audit vs. 2025 Standards

**Key Takeaway:** The MMIE's evaluation suite is strong on traditional metrics but lacks two critical components of modern (2024-2025) unlearning audits: activation-space analysis to detect residual knowledge and a robust suite of semantic transformations to test for generalization.

The MMIE's framework, with its 8+ metrics including Extraction Strength, PPL, MIA, and adversarial attacks, is a solid foundation. However, the field of unlearning evaluation is rapidly advancing to combat a "false sense of unlearning" [37] [38].

| 2025 Auditing Standard | Key Paper / Method | MMIE Coverage | Gap & Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Residual Knowledge Auditing** | Chen et al. (May 2025) - **ActPert** [12] [13] | **No** | The MMIE relies on input/output tests. **ActPert** uses intermediate activation perturbations to find residual knowledge traces. **Action:** Implement an ActPert-style audit, sweeping across layers to measure residual knowledge accessibility. |
| **Membership Inference Risk** | Du et al. (June 2024) - **U-LiRA+**, **TULA** [14] [37] | **Partial (MIA)** | MMIE includes a standard MIA. U-LiRA+ is a more rigorous per-sample MIA that found over 41% of unlearned texts were still detectable [14]. TULA shows unlearning can *increase* reconstruction risk [14]. **Action:** Upgrade the MIA to a U-LiRA+ style attack and test for reconstruction leakage. |
| **Transformation Robustness** | "Robust Evaluation via Data Transformations" (Nov 2024) | **Partial (Adversarial)** | The adversarial meta-instruction attacks are a good start. A full suite should include systematic tests for paraphrase, back-translation, synonym replacement, and style changes. **Action:** Build a transformation test set to ensure unlearning is not brittle. |
| **Distinguishing Unlearning from Obfuscation** | Shi et al. (May 2025) [39] | **No** | Proposes a probing-based framework to formally distinguish true knowledge removal from simple output obfuscation. **Action:** Incorporate probing tests to verify that the underlying representations, not just the final output, have been altered. |

This audit reveals that while the MMIE is comprehensive by 2023 standards, it must be updated to meet the more rigorous, causally-motivated standards of 2025 to be considered state-of-the-art.

## 6. Layer & Feature Selection Pipeline Deep-Dive

**Key Takeaway:** The CKA/Procrustes/ANC pipeline for layer selection is a strong correlational method, but it is not causally validated. To ensure the selected layers are true drivers of the target behavior, the pipeline must be augmented with causal intervention techniques like activation patching.

### 6.1 CKA/Procrustes/ANC Outcomes
The MMIE's methodology for selecting intervention layers uses a combination of established representation similarity measures (RSMs):
- **CKA (Canonical Correlation Analysis)** and **Procrustes Analysis** compare the geometric structure of activation spaces across layers [40].
- **ANC (Activation Neuron Correlation)** presumably identifies neurons whose activations correlate with the presence of Hindi text.

This "semantic voting" approach identifies layers where the representation of Hindi is most distinct or stable. While sophisticated, this remains a purely correlational analysis. Research shows that high representational similarity does not necessarily imply functional similarity, meaning these layers might not be the causal drivers of the model's ability to process Hindi [15].

### 6.2 Patch-then-Vote Enhancement Plan
To bridge the gap from correlation to causation, the layer selection process must incorporate causal evidence. Activation patching is the standard technique for this, involving the replacement of internal activations from one run with those from another to observe the effect on the output [16] [17].

A robust, validated protocol would be:
1. **Candidate Screening (Correlation):** Use CKA, Procrustes, and ANC to identify a set of 5-7 candidate layers where Hindi representations are prominent.
2. **Causal Validation (Intervention):** For each candidate layer, perform activation patching. Patch the activations from a Hindi prompt into a run with a non-Hindi prompt and measure the change in output (e.g., the probability of generating Hindi tokens).
3. **Final Selection (Causal Vote):** Select the 2-3 layers that demonstrate the highest causal influence on the model's Hindi-related behavior.
4. **Preregistration:** To avoid p-hacking and ensure reproducibility, the exact metrics, thresholds, and procedures for this selection process should be preregistered before the main experiments are run.

---

## 7. Comparing Feature Selection Strategies

**Key Takeaway:** An ensemble approach that combines the precision of gradient-based methods (GradSAE) with the robustness of semantic filters is the state-of-the-art for feature selection. Activation-based methods serve as a good baseline for recall but lack causal precision.

The MMIE implements three distinct routes for selecting SAE features to target for unlearning. Each has different trade-offs in terms of causal efficacy, interpretability, and computational cost.

| Feature Selection Method | Principle | Pros | Cons | SOTA Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Activation-based (Correlation)** | Selects features with the highest activation on Hindi text. | Simple, computationally cheap, high recall. | Correlational, not causal. Prone to selecting spurious or polysemantic features. | Baseline |
| **Semantic-based (Script-blind)** | Selects features that activate on Hindi concepts regardless of script (Devanagari/Roman) and are resistant to gibberish. | Robust to script variations, higher precision than pure activation. | Requires curated semantic probes, can be complex to design. | Good for Robustness |
| **Gradient-based (GradSAE-style)** | Selects features with high causal influence on the output, identified via gradients [18]. | Causal, highly precise, targets only influential features. | More computationally expensive, may have lower recall (misses weakly influential features). | SOTA for Precision |

The introduction of **GradSAE** in May 2025 was a significant advance, proving that a small subset of activated features are responsible for most of the causal work [18]. Concurrently, methods like **Dynamic SAE Guardrails (DSG)** show that dynamically applying activation-based unlearning can be highly effective and efficient [5].

**Decision Rubric:**
- For **maximum precision** (e.g., surgical removal of a specific fact), an ensemble of **GradSAE + semantic filters** is optimal. This ensures the targeted features are both causally potent and semantically correct.
- For **broader topic unlearning**, the **activation-based** route, potentially enhanced with DSG, provides a higher-recall approach that is computationally efficient.

## 8. Statistical Rigor & Experimental Design

**Key Takeaway:** The experiment's statistical design is promising but incomplete. Implementing a multiple comparison correction is non-negotiable for publication, and formal power analysis and adherence to top-tier reporting standards are required to demonstrate rigor.

### 8.1 Multiple-Comparison Controls
The MMIE's plan to use six decision gates (e.g., comparing multiple methods across multiple metrics) creates a classic multiple hypothesis testing problem. Without correction, the family-wise error rate (the probability of at least one false positive) is significantly inflated.
- **The Problem:** With six independent tests at α=0.05, the probability of at least one Type I error is 1 - (0.95)^6 ≈ 26.5%.
- **The Solution:** Instead of the overly conservative Bonferroni correction, the **Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure** is recommended for ML experiments [20]. It controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and is more powerful. Pre-registering the primary hypotheses and analysis plan is also a crucial step to prevent p-hacking [41].

### 8.2 Power Analysis & Sample Stratification
The planned sample size of 200-500 data points is a potential confound. Studies show that small sample sizes can lead to overfitting and unreliable results [42].
- **Power Analysis:** A formal power analysis should be conducted to determine the minimum sample size required to detect a meaningful effect size for the primary endpoints (e.g., Extraction Strength, MIA TPR) with sufficient statistical power (typically 80%) [43].
- **Sample Size:** If power analysis indicates the current sample size is insufficient, it must be increased. ML studies often require samples in the range of 100-1000 for stable accuracy [42].
- **Prompt Sensitivity:** The analysis should include sensitivity tests to prompt variations, as model outputs can be highly sensitive to small changes in wording.

### 8.3 Reporting & Replication Standards
For readiness at NeurIPS, ICML, or ICLR, the experiment must adhere to strict reporting standards [21] [22].
- **Metrics:** Report all metrics with uncertainty estimates (e.g., bootstrap CIs) and justify the choice of statistical tests [41] [44].
- **Reproducibility:** Provide all code, data, and exact commands to reproduce results. List all hyperparameters, how they were chosen, and the compute resources used (GPU type, total hours) [22].
- **Seed Disaggregation:** Report results for each of the 5 seeds individually, in addition to the aggregated results, to show stability.

## 9. Benchmarking Against SOTA Unlearning Algorithms

**Key Takeaway:** The MMIE's proposed methods are competitive, but to claim state-of-the-art status, they must be benchmarked against the latest and most robust unlearning algorithms and evaluation frameworks from 2024-2025.

| SOTA Paper/Method | Key Contribution | Implication for MMIE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GradSAE** (May 2025) [18] | Identifies causally influential SAE features using gradients. | MMIE's gradient-based feature selection should directly implement or compare against this. |
| **Does Unlearning Remove Knowledge?** (Chen et al., May 2025) [13] | Introduces the **ActPert** activation-based audit. | MMIE's evaluation is incomplete without this deeper, activation-level check for residual knowledge. |
| **Textual Unlearning False Sense** (Du et al., Jun 2024) [37] | Introduces **U-LiRA+** and **TULA** audits, showing unlearning can fail on paraphrases and increase privacy risk. | MMIE must test against paraphrases and use a more rigorous MIA like U-LiRA+ to avoid a "false sense" of unlearning. |
| **UNLEARN** (NAACL 2025) [23] | A novel subspace-based unlearning method that reports SOTA performance. | This is a critical missing baseline. MMIE must compare its performance against UNLEARN. |
| **Dynamic SAE Guardrails (DSG)** (Apr 2025) [5] | A dynamic, activation-based unlearning method using SAEs that outperforms gradient-based methods. | This is a direct competitor and potential upgrade to MMIE's intervention. It must be included as a baseline or adopted as the primary method. |

The current MMIE design is innovative, but without benchmarking against these recent advances, its claims of efficacy and novelty will be difficult to defend during peer review.

## 10. Gaps, Confounds & Baseline Enhancements

**Key Takeaway:** The largest remaining confounds are prompt sensitivity and the cross-script leakage identified by RomanLens. Adding targeted ablations and a more comprehensive set of baselines is essential for isolating the true effects of the proposed interventions.

**Missing Baselines:**
- **Prompting Baselines:** Zero-shot prompting (e.g., "From now on, do not mention X") and structured template prompting.
- **Ablation Baselines:** Random SAE feature ablation (to control for the effect of simply removing information) and random layer ablation.
- **Naive Forgetting:** A simple fine-tuning run on an unrelated task to measure catastrophic forgetting as a baseline for performance degradation.
- **SOTA Algorithms:** As noted, **UNLEARN** [23] and **DSG** [5] are critical missing comparisons.

**Key Confounds and Controls:**
- **Sample Size (200-500):** As discussed, this is a major risk. A power analysis is needed to confirm if this is adequate [42].
- **Prompt Sensitivity:** The model's performance can vary wildly with small changes in prompts. A sensitivity analysis using a set of paraphrased prompts for all key evaluations is necessary.
- **Script Similarity / Latent Romanization:** The RomanLens findings are the most significant confound [8]. The experiment must include ablations that unlearn: (1) Devanagari only, (2) Romanized Hindi only, and (3) both, to disentangle their effects.
- **Domain Skew:** Ensure the unlearning data and the evaluation data are drawn from the same distribution to avoid misleading results.

## 11. Publication Readiness Roadmap

**Key Takeaway:** The MMIE project is approximately 70% of the way to being ready for a top-tier conference like NeurIPS or ICML.

## Appendix A: Quick Reference - Critical Fixes

### Fix #1: Integrate ActPert Activation Audit (3 weeks, High Priority)
**Paper:** Chen et al., May 2025 (arXiv:2505.23270)
**Why:** 2025 standard for detecting residual knowledge in activation space
**Implementation:** Layer-by-layer perturbation test measuring knowledge accessibility

### Fix #2: Apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR Correction (1 week, Critical)
**Paper:** Demšar 2006 (JMLR)
**Why:** 6 decision gates without correction = 26.5% false positive rate
**Implementation:** `statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests(method='fdr_bh')`

### Fix #3: Add UNLEARN and DSG Baselines (4 weeks, High Priority)
**Papers:** UNLEARN (NAACL 2025), DSG (arXiv:2504.08192)
**Why:** Missing SOTA comparisons weaken novelty claims
**Implementation:** Implement both as baseline comparison arms

### Fix #4: Add Ethics Section on Latent Romanization (1 week, Critical)
**Paper:** RomanLens (arXiv:2502.07424)
**Why:** NeurIPS/ICML require broader impact discussion
