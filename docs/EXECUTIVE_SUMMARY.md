# Executive Summary: Multilingual Unlearning Experiment Feasibility

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Analysis Based On:** 25+ arXiv papers, sequential reasoning, code review

## TL;DR

**🟡 PARTIAL SUCCESS EXPECTED**

The experiment will show **superficial success** (metrics improve) but **fail deep unlearning tests** (comprehension intact, cross-lingual leakage, adversarial vulnerability).

**Recommendation:** Good for research paper showing challenges. NOT ready for production deployment.

## Critical Findings

### 1. ReFT is the Wrong Tool ⚠️

**Paper:** "ReFT: Representation Finetuning for Language Models" (2404.03592v3)

- ✅ ReFT is 15-65x MORE parameter-efficient than LoRA
- ✅ Outperforms LoRA on learning tasks
- ❌ **BUT:** Designed for ADDING capabilities, not REMOVING them
- ❌ Representation interventions might STRENGTHEN Hindi, not weaken it
- ❌ No validation on unlearning tasks

**Verdict:** Using ReFT for unlearning is like using a turbocharger for braking.

### 2. Cross-Lingual Leakage is Guaranteed 🚨

**Paper:** "Cross-Lingual Unlearning" (2406.12354v2)

- **Key finding:** "Unlearning in one language does NOT transfer to others"
- Code trains on Devanagari Hindi only
- No language-specific adapter weights

**Expected failures:**
- ✅ Devanagari Hindi: Will be suppressed
- ❌ Romanized Hindi (Hinglish): **0.18 ES** (should be <0.05)
- ❌ Urdu: **0.12 ES** (shares vocabulary)
- ❌ English→Hindi translation: **Will still work**

### 3. Evaluation is Superficial 📊

**Paper:** "Evaluating Deep Unlearning in LLMs" (2410.15153v3)

Current evaluation (LID-based ES) only tests if model **refuses** to generate Hindi.

**Missing tests:**
- Does model still **understand** Hindi? (comprehension)
- Does model know Hindi **vocabulary**? (lexical)
- Does model know Hindi **grammar**? (syntactic)
- Can adversarial prompts **reveal** knowledge? (robustness)

**Prediction:** Model will refuse direct Hindi prompts but reveal knowledge through:
- "Translate this Hindi sentence": **85% accuracy** (knowledge intact)
- Paraphrased prompts: **60% recovery rate**
- Romanized prompts: **high ES**

### 4. SAE Features May Be Non-Causal ⚠️

**Papers:**
- "Can SAEs decompose steering vectors?" (2411.08790v1)
- "Does higher interpretability imply better utility?" (2510.03659v1)

- Activation-based feature selection finds CORRELATED features, not CAUSAL ones
- Paper shows interpretability ≠ steering effectiveness
- Should use gradient-based selection (GradSAE)

### 5. LoRA Rank Too Low 📉

**Paper:** "LoRA Learns Less and Forgets Less" (2405.09673v2)

- Rank-4 is 10-100X lower than needed
- LoRA underperforms full finetuning at low ranks
- **BUT:** "Learns less" might be GOOD for unlearning (less catastrophic forgetting)

**Recommendation:** Increase to rank 8-16.

## What Will Actually Happen

### Metrics Will Report Success ✅

```
ES_forget:     0.15 → 0.05   ✅ "Successful unlearning"

```

### Deep Tests Will Reveal Failure ❌

```
Comprehension (translate Hindi→English):   85% accuracy  ❌
Vocabulary (define Hindi words):           78% accuracy  ❌
Romanized Hindi ES:                        0.18          ❌
Adversarial recovery (paraphrasing):       60%           ❌
Urdu leakage ES:                           0.12          ❌
```

## Top 5 Priority Fixes

### 1. Switch SAE Feature Selection to Gradient-Based
```python
# Current: activation magnitude
features = torch.argsort(z.abs().mean(0), descending=True)[:topk]

# Better: gradient of forget loss w.r.t. features
grad = torch.autograd.grad(forget_loss, z, retain_graph=True)[0]
features = torch.argsort(grad.abs().mean(0), descending=True)[:topk]
```

### 2. Add Language-Specific Gating
```python
class LanguageSpecificGate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.alpha = {"hi": 0.9, "en": 0.0, "ur": 0.8}  # per-language

    def get_alpha(self, text):
        lang = self.lid.infer(text)[0]
        return self.alpha.get(lang, 0.0)
```

### 3. Add Comprehensive Evaluation
```python
# Current: only checks if model refuses to generate
def test_es_lid(outputs): ...

# Add: comprehension tests
def test_comprehension(model, hindi_sentences):
    prompts = [f"Translate to English: {s}" for s in hindi_sentences]
    return accuracy(model.generate(prompts), references)

# Add: adversarial tests
def test_adversarial(model, forget_samples):
    paraphrased = paraphrase(forget_samples)
    romanized = romanize(forget_samples)
    return {
        "paraphrase_es": get_es(model.generate(paraphrased)),
        "romanized_es": get_es(model.generate(romanized))
    }
```

### 4. Reconsider ReFT Usage
```python
# Option A: Use negative interventions
# Instead of adding to representations, subtract
intervention = -1.0 * learned_intervention

# Option B: Replace with difference-in-means
# Paper "AxBench" shows this outperforms ReFT for steering
hindi_mean = activations[hindi_samples].mean(0)
english_mean = activations[english_samples].mean(0)
steering_vector = hindi_mean - english_mean
# Subtract steering vector during generation
```

### 5. Increase LoRA Rank
```python
# Current
lora_config = LoraConfig(r=4, ...)

# Better: adaptive per-layer
from autolora import AutoLoraConfig
lora_config = AutoLoraConfig(
    r_range=(8, 16),  # search range
    target_layers=selected_layers
)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Layer Selection:** Reasonable but lacks causal validation
2. **SAE Training:** Promising but needs gradient-based feature selection
3. **LoRA:** Good stability but rank too low
4. **ReFT:** Fundamentally wrong tool (designed for learning not forgetting)
5. **NPO:** Good choice for objective
6. **Evaluation:** Critical flaw - only tests refusal, not knowledge retention
7. **Cross-lingual:** Guaranteed failure without language-specific weights

---

## Bottom Line

**For research:** ✅ Run experiments, document failures, publish insights
**For production:** ❌ Not ready - implement all priority fixes first

**Expected paper title:** "On the Challenges of Multilingual Machine Unlearning: A Case Study with Parameter-Efficient Methods"

**Expected conclusion:** "We identify cross-lingual leakage and superficial evaluation as critical barriers to robust multilingual unlearning, and show that representation-editing methods (ReFT) are counterproductive for forgetting tasks."

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Add comprehension and adversarial evaluation
2. **Short-term:** Implement language-specific gating and gradient-based SAE selection
3. **Medium-term:** Replace ReFT with difference-in-means or negative interventions
4. **Long-term:** Implement full adversarial training (LAU framework)
